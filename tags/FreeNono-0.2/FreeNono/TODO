FreeNono - a simple board game - Version 0.1
============================================

to-do
-----
 - fix bugs at restart, game over, solved puzzle ...!!!
 - add NonogramsFromZIP, NonogramsFromNet!
 - include filename into NonogramProviders and allow to get filename for the current nonogram
 - implement calling FNE directly from FreeNono
 - write Mission Statement :-)
 - write NonogramServer to provide nonograms over the Internet
 - add course xml file + xsd for each course directory or zip file

organization:
 - Should the standard directory to search for named nonogram files be configurable?
 - implement logging in all classes
 - Try to find a standard file format for nonograms, or define mine as one :-)
   (see http://webpbn.com/export.cgi
        http://webpbn.com/pbn_fmt.html
        http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/~ss/nonogram/fmt2
        http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/~ss/nonogram/xmlfmt)
 - add im-/export for foreign file formats

structures:
 - change storage of row and column numbers in nonogram to lists!  
 - integrate used colors and min and max board sizes in SETTINGS class 
 
game mechanic:
 - add support for playing whole courses (so the program has to save the state of the
   course: until which nonogram was played, what times were played, ...
 - add more random nonogram algorithms (MtWi)
 - change game model so that there are some possible game types (ENUM?)
 	- Play against the clock (time starts at 0)
 	- Play with limited time
 	- Play with maximum number of fails
 	- Play with time penalty (like Marios Picross), the time is decreased for every fail

gui:
 - better GameOver Dialog
 - The GUI must show, in what state the current game is
 - StatusBar text should always show useful information
 - check whether two digit numbers could be displayed correctly
 
misc:
 - improve AudioProvider 
    - add initWAV to initialize subsystems
    - open lines up to MAXIMUM_AUDIO_LINES and use them repeatedly
    - extract sound file names to SETTINGS class
 - divide between global settings and game related settings!
 - use getURI() instead of getObject for resources???
 - add image to nonogram converter
 - implement nonogram checker, that checks, whether a nonogram is unique solvable
 - implement a highscore
 - implement a nonogram by seed algorithm (MD5, SHA1...)

documentation:
 - add LaTeX documentation 
 - implement FreeNono logo in TikZ
 - ...
 

done
----
 - Preview must have a fix aspect ratio and a maximum zoom.
 - Try to set field width and height to fix values. Also added the getPreferedSize function.
 - Menu entries for restart and stop should only be enabled, if their action is possible
 - Find a better name for the project !IMPORTANT! => FreeNono
 - add a options menu to the UI
 - use svn for code versioning
 - advanced, tabbed OptionsDialog (program options and game options)
