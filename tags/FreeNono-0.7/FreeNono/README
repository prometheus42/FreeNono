FreeNono - A free implementation of the nonogram game
=====================================================
date:    @date@
version: @version@


DESCRIPTION
-----------
FreeNono is an open-source implementation of the Nonogram game — a logic puzzle
in which cells in a grid have to be colored or left blank according to numbers
given at the side of the grid to reveal a hidden picture.


LICENSE
-------
FreeNono is released under the GNU General Public License v2 or newer.


REQUIREMENTS
------------
FreeNono requires Java SE 6 Update 10 or later.


PROBLEMS
--------
Because of problems with the Aero user interface under Windows Vista or
Windows 7 double buffering was deactivated under these operating systems.
Therefore the rendering of the main window and game board may look a little
bit ugly.

If you installed the Debian/Ubuntu package of FreeNono it is possible to
control it with a game pad or joystick. This feature is experimental and not
yet fully implemented. If the game pad or joystick is in stand-by while
starting a game some errors may occur.

features, etc.
