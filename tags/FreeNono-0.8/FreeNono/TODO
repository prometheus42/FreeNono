FreeNono - A free implementation of the nonogram game
=====================================================

TODO
----

This list contains *only* internal issues. All bugs and feature requests
should be entered in the ticket system on Sourceforge!
 
organization:
 - implement logging in all classes
 - move nonograms to their own project
 - order packages by feature, not layer?!

implementation:
 - use better(?) data structures for board data and nonogram data (e.g.
   BitSet???)
 - replace uses of arrays with Collections
 - return only unmodifiable Collections from providers 
   (Collections.unmodifiableList())
 - implement access control for settings object?
 - should AudioProvider and HighscoreManager be static utility classes or
   singletons?
 -  
 
gui:
 - add key bindings in dialogs like "_N_ext"...
 - integrate min and max board sizes in SETTINGS class
 - store window position in SETTINGS class
 - set parent for all dialogs
 - show number of nonograms and their difficulty for every course
 - use circular color gradient for pause glass pane with color with alpha
   channel (Color(0,0,0,0))
 -  

network:
 - move all nonoserver write and read handling code into nonogramToServer and 
   nonogramFromServer classes. 
 - implement DHT to look for all available nonograms in the swarm and publish all 
   hash for own nonograms
 - use CouchDB or something like that for a complete reimplementation of NonoServer.
 - 
   
misc:
 - change setting class to use put() and get() methods to set and get options from a 
   dictionary
 - use Robot class to create JUnit tests for the UI. 
 - extract sound file names to SETTINGS class
 - catch exception when old settings file is loaded
 - divide between global settings and game related settings!
 - implement nonogram checker, that checks, whether a nonogram is unique solvable
 - write Mission Statement :-)
