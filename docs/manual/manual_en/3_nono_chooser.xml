	<para>
		Under "random nonograms" automatically generated nonograms 
		can be found. The last generated and played nonograms are saved
		and shown on the right side of the window.
		To generate a new random nonogram click with the right mouse button
		on "Nonogram by seed" and choose "New seed..." in the context menu.
		After that you are requested to input a string of characters. A
		generated nonogram for the same characters looks always the same.
	</para>

	<para>
		Including the FreeNono release are some nonograms. These are found 
		under "Local Nonograms" and are organized in courses. Courses contain
		similar nonograms, e.g. all nonograms in the course "Kanji Class"
		show japanese kanji characters.
	</para>

	<para>
		The folder "User Nonograms" shows all nonograms copied into the 
		directory "nonograms" inside the config directory of FreeNono.
