=====================================================
date:    @date@
version: @version@


to-do
-----
 - add DropBox in OptionsDialog to choose GameMode!
 - implement calling FNE directly from FreeNono
 - add NonogramsFromZIP as provider
 - write Mission Statement :-)
 - implement more GameModes...
 - add course xml file + xsd for each course directory or zip file
 - move nonograms to their own project

organization:
 - Should the standard directory to search for named nonogram files be configurable?
 - implement logging in all classes
 - Try to find a standard file format for nonograms, or define mine as one :-)
   (see http://webpbn.com/export.cgi

        http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/~ss/nonogram/fmt2
        http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/~ss/nonogram/xmlfmt)
 - add im-/export for foreign file formats
 
game mechanic:
 - add support for playing whole courses (so the program has to save the state of the
   course: until which nonogram was played, what times were played, ...
 - add more random nonogram algorithms (MtWi)
 - change game model so that there are some possible game types (ENUM?)
 	- Play against the clock (time starts at 0)
 	- Play with limited time
 	- Play with maximum number of fails
 	- Play with time penalty (like Marios Picross), the time is decreased for every fail

gui:
 - rename AboutDialog to HelpDialog and fill it with a nice html help page!
 - integrate used colors and min and max board sizes in SETTINGS class
 - The GUI must show, in what state the current game is
 - StatusBar text should always show useful information
 - check whether two digit numbers could be displayed correctly
 - better GameOver Dialog
 
misc:
 - improve AudioProvider 
    - add initWAV to initialize subsystems
    - open lines up to MAXIMUM_AUDIO_LINES and use them repeatedly
    - extract sound file names to SETTINGS class
 - divide between global settings and game related settings!
 - add image to nonogram converter
 - implement nonogram checker, that checks, whether a nonogram is unique solvable
 - implement a highscore

documentation:
 - add LaTeX documentation 
 - implement FreeNono logo in TikZ
 - ...
