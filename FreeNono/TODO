Nonogram - a simple board game

 Version 0.0
=============
to-do:
 
 - Do we need a standard directory to search for named nonogram files?
   Where should it be held? Make it configurable?
 - Automatically mark fields, that are obviously invalid. (optional, requested by ChWi)
 - create better implementation of the board
 - The GUI must show, in what state the current game is
 - StatusBar text should always show useful information
 - Try to find a stadard file format for nonograms, or define mine as one :-)
 - implement logging in all classes
 
 - add random nonogram generator (MtWi)
 - add image to nonogram converter
(- add im-/export for foreign file formats)
 - implement nonogram checker, that checks, whether a nonogram is unique solvable
 - check whether two digit numbers could be displayed correctly
 - implement a highscore
 - add keyboard support
 
 
done:
 - Preview must have a fix aspect ratio and a maximum zoom.
 - Try to set field width and height to fix values. Also added the getPreferedSize function.
 - Menu entries for restart and stop should only be enabled, if their action is possible
 - Find a better name for the project !IMPORTANT! => FreeNono
 - add a options menu to the UI
 - use svn for code versioning
