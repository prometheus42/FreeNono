FreeNono - A free implementation of the nonogram game
=====================================================
date:    @date@
version: @version@


to-do
-----
 - delete parameter id from all nonograms and from the source code.
 - implement DHT to look for all available nonograms in the swarm and publish all 
   hash for own nonograms
 - implement calling FNE directly from FreeNono
 - move nonograms to their own project

organization:
 - Should the standard directory to search for named nonogram files be configurable?
 - implement logging in all classes
 - Try to find a standard file format for nonograms, or define mine as one :-)
   (see http://webpbn.com/export.cgi
        http://webpbn.com/pbn_fmt.html
        http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/~ss/nonogram/fmt2
        http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/~ss/nonogram/xmlfmt)
 - add im-/export for foreign file formats
 - change setting class to use put() and get() methods to set and get options from a 
   dictionary
 - add NonogramsFromZIP as provider
 - add course xml file + xsd for each course directory or zip file???
   
game mechanic:
 - add support for playing whole courses (so the program has to save the state of the
   course: until which nonogram was played, what times were played, ...
 - add more random nonogram algorithms (MtWi)
 - implement more GameModes...
 	- play against the clock (time starts at 0)
 	- add quiz game mode (after every error a question has to be answered correctly)

gui:
 - organize and store game color set
    - integrate used colors and min and max board sizes in SETTINGS class
    - or add new game color class to organize used colors
 - build a new AboutDialog (maybe a nice html page)
 - change HelpDialog to load html data for help page from file system
 - add statistics data to GameOver Dialog or add new dialog for this
 - StatusBar text should always show useful information
 
misc:
 - extract sound file names to SETTINGS class
 - divide between global settings and game related settings!
 - implement nonogram checker, that checks, whether a nonogram is unique solvable
 - implement a highscore
 - implement a listener interface for provider to notify gui when new nonograms
   are added on a server or in the file system
 - write Mission Statement :-)
 
documentation:
 - add LaTeX documentation 
 - implement FreeNono logo in TikZ
 - ...
