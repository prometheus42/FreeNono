# FreeNono - A free implementation of the nonogram game

## Description

FreeNono is an open-source implementation of the nonogram game — a logic puzzle
in which cells in a grid have to be colored or left blank according to numbers
given at the side of the grid to reveal a hidden picture.

With FreeNono comes a collection of thousands of nonogram riddles that can be
played in many different game modes. They can be played against the clock, with
penalties for every wrong move, like solving a nonogram on paper, ...

## License

FreeNono is released under the GNU General Public License v2 or newer.

Many of the distributed nonograms are of our own design. But some were
collected from different sources on the internet and out of magazines. If your
nonogram found its way into FreeNono and you do not want that, please inform
us and we will remove it from our distribution.

## Requirements

FreeNono requires Java SE 7 or later.

## Problems

If you installed the Debian/Ubuntu package of FreeNono it is possible to
control it with a game pad or joystick. This feature is experimental and not
yet fully implemented. If the game pad or joystick is in stand-by while
starting a game some errors may occur.

Please go to <http://www.freenono.org/> to submit bug reports, request new
features, etc.
