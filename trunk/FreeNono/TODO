FreeNono - A free implementation of the nonogram game
=====================================================

TODO
----
organization:
 - use better(?) data structures for board data and nonogram data (e.g. BitSet???)
 - implement logging in all classes
 - move nonograms to their own project
 - order packages by feature, not layer?!

gui:
 - integrate min and max board sizes in SETTINGS class
 - set parent for all dialogs

network:
 - move all nonoserver write and read handling code into nonogramToServer and 
   nonogramFromServer classes. 
 - implement DHT to look for all available nonograms in the swarm and publish all 
   hash for own nonograms
   
misc:
 - change setting class to use put() and get() methods to set and get options from a 
   dictionary
 - extract sound file names to SETTINGS class
 - catch exception when old settings file is loaded
 - divide between global settings and game related settings!
 - implement nonogram checker, that checks, whether a nonogram is unique solvable
 - write Mission Statement :-)
