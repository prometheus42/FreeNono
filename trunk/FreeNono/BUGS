------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0001	frontend		resolved		The user can mark and occupy fields on the board
										during pause in game play.

0002	backend			resolved		If the user opens a second nonogram which is
										larger than the first, an OutOfBounds Exception is
										thrown.

0003	frontend		resolved		If width and height of a chosen nonogram are
										different the produced preview is not correct!

0004	frontend		resolved		For nonograms with very big width or height the 
										layout of the statusComponent is bad. It should use
										the best possible arrangement to show its parts. 
										
0005	save/load		resolved		Settings won't be saved if the program is exited
										through the x button.
										
*** In the future bugs should be reported via the projects bug tracker ***
